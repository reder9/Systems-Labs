      subroutine dgesl(a,lda,n,ipvt,b,job)
      integer lda,n,ipvt(1),job
      double precision a(lda,1),b(1)
c
c     dgesl solves the double precision system
c     a * x = b  or  trans(a) * x = b
c     using the factors computed by dgeco or dgefa.
c
c     on entry
c
c        a       double precision(lda, n)
c                the output from dgeco or dgefa.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  a .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .
c
c        ipvt    integer(n)
c                the pivot vector from dgeco or dgefa.
c
c        b       double precision(n)
c                the right hand side vector.
c
c        job     integer
c                = 0         to solve  a*x = b ,
c                = nonzero   to solve  trans(a)*x = b  where
c                            trans(a)  is the transpose.
c
c     on return
c
c        b       the solution vector  x .
c
c     error condition
c
c        a division by zero will occur if the input factor contains a
c        zero on the diagonal.  technically this indicates singularity
c        but it is often caused by improper arguments or improper
c        setting of lda .  it will not occur if the subroutines are
c        called correctly and if dgeco has set rcond .gt. 0.0
c        or dgefa has set info .eq. 0 .
c
c     to compute  inverse(a) * c  where  c  is a matrix
c     with  p  columns
c           call dgeco(a,lda,n,ipvt,rcond,z)
c           if (rcond is too small) go to ...
c           do 10 j = 1, p
