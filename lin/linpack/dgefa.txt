      subroutine dgefa(a,lda,n,ipvt,info)
      integer lda,n,ipvt(1),info
      double precision a(lda,1)
c
c     dgefa factors a double precision matrix by gaussian elimination.
c
c     dgefa is usually called by dgeco, but it can be called
c     directly with a saving in time if  rcond  is not needed.
c     (time for dgeco) = (1 + 9/n)*(time for dgefa) .
c
c     on entry
c
c        a       double precision(lda, n)
c                the matrix to be factored.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  a .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .
c
c     on return
c
c        a       an upper triangular matrix and the multipliers
c                which were used to obtain it.
c                the factorization can be written  a = l*u  where
c                l  is a product of permutation and unit lower
c                triangular matrices and  u  is upper triangular.
c
c        ipvt    integer(n)
c                an integer vector of pivot indices.
c
c        info    integer
c                = 0  normal value.
c                = k  if  u(k,k) .eq. 0.0 .  this is not an error
c                     condition for this subroutine, but it does
c                     indicate that dgesl or dgedi will divide by zero
c                     if called.  use  rcond  in dgeco for a reliable
c                     indication of singularity.
